:Date: January 28, 2021
:Installation: `Installing Percona Kubernetes Operator for Percona XtraDB Cluster <https://www.percona.com/doc/kubernetes-operator-for-pxc/index.html#quickstart-guides>`_

New Features
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-530`: Add support for :ref:`point-in-time recovery<backups-pitr-binlog>`
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-564`: PXC cluster will now recover automatically from a full crash when Pods are stuck in CrashLoopBackOff status
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-497`: Official support for :ref:`Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) v.2<operator.monitoring>`

  .. note:: Monitoring with PMM v.1 configured according to the `unofficial instruction <https://www.percona.com/blog/2020/07/23/using-percona-kubernetes-operators-with-percona-monitoring-and-management/>`_
     will not work after the upgrade. Please switch to PMM v.2.

Improvements
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-485`: :ref:`Percona XtraDB Cluster Pod logs are now stored on Persistent Volumes<debug-images-logs>`. Users can debug the issues even after the Pod restart
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-389`: User can now change ServiceType for HAProxy replicas Kubernetes service
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-546`: Reduce the number of ConfigMap object updates from the Operator to improve performance of the Kubernetes cluster
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-553`: Change default configuration of ProxySQL to WRITERS_ARE_READERS=yes so Percona XtraDB Cluster continues operating with a single node left
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-512`: User can now limit cluster-wide Operator access to specific namespaces (Thanks to user mgar for contribution)
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-490`: Improve error message when not enough memory is set for auto-tuning
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-312`: Add schema validation for Custom Resource. Now ``cr.yaml`` is validated by a WebHook for syntax typos before being applied. It works only in cluster-wide mode due to access restrictions
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-510`: Percona XtraDB Cluster operator can now be `deployed through RedHat Marketplace <https://marketplace.redhat.com/en-us/products/percona-kubernetes-operator-for-percona-server-for-xtradb-cluster>`_
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-543`: Check HAProxy custom configuration for syntax errors before applying it to avoid Pod getting stuck in CrashLoopBackOff status (Thanks to user pservit for reporting this issue)

Bugs Fixed
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-544`: Add a liveness probe for HAProxy so it is not stuck and automatically restarted when crashed (Thanks to user pservit for reporting this issue)
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-500`: Fix a bug that prevented creating a backup in cluster-wide mode if default cr.yaml is used (Thanks to user michael.lin1 for reporting this issue)
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-491`: Fix a bug due to which compressed backups didnâ€™t work with the Operator (Thanks to user dejw for reporting this issue)
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-570`: Fix a bug causing backups to fail with some S3-compatible storages (Thanks to user dimitrij for reporting this issue)
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-517`: Fix a bug causing Operator crash if Custom Resource backup section is missing (Thanks to user deamonmv for reporting this issue)
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-253`: Fix a bug preventing rolling out Custom Resource changes (Thanks to user bitsbeats for reporting this issue)
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-552`: Fix a bug when HAProxy secrets cannot be updated by the user

* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-526`: Fix a bug due to which not all clusters managed by the Operator were upgraded by the automatic update
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-523`: Fix a bug putting cluster into unhealthy status after the clustercheck secret changed
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-521`: Fix automatic upgrade job repeatedly looking for an already removed cluster
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-520`: Fix Smart update in cluster-wide mode adding version service check job repeatedly instead of doing it only once
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-463`: Fix a bug due to which wsrep_recovery log was unavailable after the Pod restart
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-424`: Fix a bug due to which HAProxy health-check spammed in logs, making them hardly unreadable
