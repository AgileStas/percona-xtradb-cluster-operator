================================================================================
*Percona Kubernetes Operator for Percona XtraDB Cluster* 1.8.0
================================================================================

:Date: April 13, 2021
:Installation: `Installing Percona Kubernetes Operator for Percona XtraDB Cluster <https://www.percona.com/doc/kubernetes-operator-for-pxc/index.html#quickstart-guides>`_

Release Highlights
================================================================================

* It is now `possible <https://www.percona.com/doc/kubernetes-operator-for-pxc/scaling.html>`_
  to use ``kubectl scale`` command to scale Percona XtraDB Cluster horizontally
  (adding or removing Replica Set instances). You can also use  `Horizontal Pod
  Autoscaler <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/>`_
  which will scale your database cluster based on various metrics, such as CPU utilization. 
* Support for :ref:`custom sidecar containers<faq-sidecar>`. The Operator makes
  it possible now to deploy additional (sidecar) containers to the Pod. This
  feature can be useful to run debugging tools or some specific monitoring
  solutions, etc. The sidecar container can be added to 
  :ref:`pxc<pxc-sidecars-image>`,
  :ref:`haproxy<haproxy-sidecars-image>`, and
  :ref:`proxysql<proxysql-image>` sections of the ``deploy/cr.yaml``
  configuration file.

New Features
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-528`: Support for :ref:`custom sidecar containers<faq-sidecar>`
  to extend the Operator capabilities
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-647`: Allow the cluster :ref:`scale in and scale out<operator-scale>`
  with the ``kubectl scale`` command or Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-643`: Operator can now automatically recover Percona XtraDB
  Cluster after the `network partitioning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_partition>`_

Improvements
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-654`: Use MySQL administrative port for Kubernetes
  liveness/readiness probes to avoid false positive failures
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-442`: The Operator can now automatically remove old backups
  from S3 if the retention period is set (thanks to Davi S Evangelista for reporting this issue)
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-697`: Add namespace support in the script used to
  :ref:` script used to copy backups<backups-copy>` from remote storage to a
  local machine
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-627`: Make log collector choosing Pod with the oldest binlog
  in the cluster in case of failed log uploading
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-618`: Add debug symbols to Percona XtraDB Cluster debug
  docker image to simplify troubleshooting
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-599`: It is now possible to recover databases up to specific
  transactions with the Point-in-time Recovery feature. Previously the user
  could only recover to specific date and time.
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-598`: Point-in-time recovery feature now works with
  compressed backups
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-536`: It is now possible to explicitly set the version of
  Percona XtraDB Cluster for newly provisioned clusters. Before that, all new
  clusters were started with the latest PXC version if Version Service was
  enabled
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-522`: Add support for the ``runtimeClassName`` Kubernetes
  feature for selecting the container runtime
* K8SPXC-519, K8SPXC-558, and K8SPXC-637: Improve various log messages for better
  clearness and more precise description

Known Issues and Limitations
================================================================================

* Scheduled backups are not compatible with the Kubernetes 1.20 in cluster-wide
  mode.
